    <h1>Fallout 2</h1>

    <p>Fallout 2 (also known as Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game) is a 1998 role-playing video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Productions. It is a sequel to Fallout (1997), featuring similar graphics and game mechanics. The game's story takes place in 2241, 80 years after the events of Fallout and 164 years after the atomic war which reduced the vast majority of the world to a nuclear wasteland. The player assumes the role of The Chosen One, the grandchild of the first game's protagonist, and undertakes a quest to save their small village on the West Coast of the United States.

        Fallout 2 was well received by critics, who praised its gameplay and storyline, and considered it a worthy successor to the original Fallout. Its bugs and limited updates to the formula of the first game attracted criticism. In 2008, it was followed by a sequel, Fallout 3, developed by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>
    <p>Fallout 2 is a role-playing video game. The player character is free to move until they enter into combat. Combat gives a number of action points to move, fire, check their equipment, reload and the like.

        When a player uses up all of their action points, they end their turn and enemies start theirs. If the player survives unharmed, they have their action points restored. Injuries and poisons can reduce the number of action points available both in a single turn and semi-permanently, until combat ends and the player can be treated. </p>
